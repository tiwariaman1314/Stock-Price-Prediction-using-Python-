Title: Stock Price Prediction using AI/ML

Description:
During my final year of MCA (Masters of Computer Application), I undertook an exciting project focused on predicting stock prices using advanced AI/ML techniques. This project aims to leverage the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide investors and traders with valuable insights into the unpredictable world of stock markets.

Key Features:

Machine Learning Models: The project includes the implementation of various machine learning algorithms, such as Linear Regression, LSTM, and XGBoost, to analyze historical stock data and generate accurate predictions.

Data Preprocessing: Robust data preprocessing techniques have been employed to clean and prepare the raw stock market data, ensuring the models receive high-quality inputs.

Web-based Interface: The application boasts a user-friendly web-based interface, empowering users to input relevant stock data, select preferred models, and obtain real-time predictions conveniently.

Interactive Visualization: To enhance user experience and understanding, interactive charts and graphs display historical stock prices and model predictions, aiding in identifying trends and patterns.

Model Evaluation Metrics: The performance of the models is rigorously evaluated using a range of metrics to continuously improve accuracy and reliability.

RESTful API: The backend is designed with a RESTful API architecture, making it versatile and easily integrable with various front-end applications and services.

Deployment Instructions: Comprehensive guidelines are provided to deploy the project on a cloud platform or a local server, ensuring seamless accessibility.

Note: As this project may involve financial data and stock market predictions, it is essential to adhere to the necessary legal and ethical guidelines while utilizing and sharing the code.
